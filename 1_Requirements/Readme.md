# Requirements
## Introduction
A fully functional password maneger which involves operation to save the account credentials, retrive account credentials, generate passwords, delete account credentials. This project can be used by anyone in day to day life.
## Research
A [study](https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmjvm9/hundreds-of-thousands-of-people-are-using-passwords-that-have-already-been-hacked-google-says) by google confirmed internet users need to stop same password for multiple website unless they are keen on having their data hijacked. But using different passwords for different websites creates another problem. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3515440/) from 2012 shows relation between passwords usage and human memory limitations. regarding the frequency with which participants reported memory difficulties, a large number of participants reported forgetting or mixing up passwords (72%) in the present sample. Thus concluding all these findings a system which can be used to save and retrive password securely So that users don't need to remeber all this information is needed.
## Cost and Features and Timeline
As far as the project is well built and all the requirements met the cost can be varied according to the market.
## Defining Our System
The system mainly involves two operation modes. They modifying master username or password and user credential operations. All the operation are subdivided into operations where user can choose the operation he wants and can perform accordingly.
# SWOT Analysis

### WHO
The project can be used almost by all. All the users accros the world who use different social media accounts have credentials to save can use the program to save their credentials. At the end, user satisfaction is the goal of the project.
### WHAT
Program can save account credential of the user securely. User can also use the program to generate passwords.
### WHEN
The project can be used in day to day life. So that user don't have to remeber all the passwords for so many website or organisations
### WHERE
In all the domains it can be used. As the project is portable and user-friendly, it can be easily implemented on the mobile systems and finance companies. It should overcome all the drawbacks of the Old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements.
### HOW
System design is a solution for “HOW TO” approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.
